# OpenADMS Server API Access from Python 3

The example uses the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
library to access the REST API of an OpenADMS Server instance. You may want to
install the dependencies inside a virtual environment first:

```
$ python3 -m venv virtual-environment
$ source virtual-environment/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install requests
$ python3 ./client.py
```
