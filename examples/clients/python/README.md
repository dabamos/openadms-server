# OpenADMS Server API Access from Python 3

The example uses the
[Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to access the
REST API of an OpenADMS Server instance. You may want to install the
dependencies inside a virtual environment first:

```
$ python3 -m venv virtual-environment
$ source virtual-environment/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install requests
$ python3 ./client.py
```
