# OpenADMS Server API Access from JavaScript

Basic example that uses [jQuery](https://www.jquery.com/) and
[Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) to query observations from an OpenADMS
Server instance, then displays the fetched CSV data inside a table.

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser.
